Here is an example for training the cheetah environment with VPG. The main function you should have in mind is the `train_agent` function which runs the experiments for you. If you are sweeping parameters or seeds, you can write a for loop, construct the different parts (agents, policies, baselines etc.) with required hyperparameters and pass them to the `train_agent` function. Make sure to give it different `job_names` so that data is not overwritten.
